Experience Hub is an online platform that allows users to find interesting experiences listed by merchants and book them. This application allows you to find unique activities at great prices, and allows you to send booking enquiries to the merchants so that you can enjoy your experience. 

## Database / Storage
* **MongoDB** - NoSQL database using collections and documents
* **Cloudinary** - Cloud media management service that efficiently creates, manages and delivers images, videos and other media, personalized and optimized for every device and channel.


## Technologies Used
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Cors
* Bcrypt
* Express-session
* ReactJS
* Axios
* HTML5, CSS , Bootstrap


## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete) with the MVC framework (Model, View, Controller) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).

## User Stories
* As a merchant, I will like to be able to create an account with the following information:
    * Company Name
    * Email Address
    * Password
    * Company Description
    * Logo
* As a merchant, I will also like to be able to create and list experiences with the following information
    * Experience Name
    * Price
    * Experience Image
    * Description
    * Address
    * Link it to MerchantId
  

## Approach Taken
* Set up MVC structure with basic CRUD routes for in the backend
* Set up database with relevant collections and schema validation in MongoDB 
* Build authentication flow for Merchant in the frontend
* Update UX layer with HTML, CSS enhancements
* Deploy frontend and backend to Heroku

## Accomplishments
* Experience Hub meets the minimum viable product (MVP) requirements with full CRUD features
* Merchant Authentication
* Using new technologies (e.g. Axios, Cloudinary React API)
* Solidifying knowledge of building applications with Microservices Architecture (instead of more commonly used Monolithic Architecture)

## Future Development
* Continue building out more advanced features for the application
* Search features for experiences
* Additional Social Login Authentication (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc)
* Integrating additional 3rd-party APIs to further enhance the application's features (e.g. Google Maps API, Live Chat, E-Commerce / Payments APIs etc.)
